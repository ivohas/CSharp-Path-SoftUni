I've tailored the README to reflect that this is a comprehensive repository containing all your work throughout the SoftUni C# learning path, rather than a single project. The structure now matches the folders visible in the screenshot, and the description emphasizes the repository's nature as a learning journey archive.

Would you like me to make any further modifications?
